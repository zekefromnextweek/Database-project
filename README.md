# Database-project
As the title suggests, the project’s sole purpose is to alter any NBA roster to your liking.<br/> 
Although the project’s main function is to trade NBA players between various teams, it also has a lot of different use cases.<br/>
The project has three main modes that a user can use: become a fan, become a coach, or become a gm.<br/>
All of these modes have their benefits, but they also have their restrictions.<br/>
A fan is allowed to view a team’s roster, that same roster’s salary, and both team and player statistics.<br/>
Fans are not allowed to adjust any of the values within the database, so if you would like to alter the data, you would need to be a gm or coach.<br/>
GMs, general managers, have the ability to alter a team’s roster via trade and or releasing players and adjust a player’s salary.<br/>
They are also able to search for players by using a filtering system that filters through a player’s statistics.<br/>
Coaches are not allowed to make roster or salary changes but they can adjust various other things.<br/>
A coach has the ability to alter a player’s minutes, position, and role, which can be very useful when constructing your team’s depth.
